            <p>In addition to his performance opportunities & experience, James also has recognizable teaching achievements as well. As part of his experiences with the Lincoln-Way Marching Band, James was responsible for teaching and helping guide a saxophone section of more than 20 students on music & visual through running sectionals, 1-on-1 assistance, and other leadership/teaching opportunities. In 2021, James joined the music staff at Providence Catholic High School, where he worked with the PCHS marching band winds on visual and music. The 2021 PCHS marching band secured several high placements and class awards during the season, and ultimately ended at 2nd in class 2A and a finals spot at the 2021 Illinois State Marching Band Championships. James has also worked with students from the Lincoln Park High School bands, where he worked sectionals with the students and taught ensemble and individual skills.<br><br>

            James maintains an active private studio of saxophone & clarinet students. Students of his have earned Superior ratings at Solo & Ensemble contests and have earned higher placements in their school music programs, among other opportunities. He has tutored students in music theory, aural training, fundamental piano skills, and has experience with doubling on other woodwind instruments such as clarinet, flute, oboe, and bassoon.</p>
